    <h1>STORY</h1><br>
    <p>Several years after the Order of the Sword incident...
        An unusual phenomenon suddenly appears in Red Grave City.<br><br><br><br>
        A gigantic tree pierces through the surface in the middle of town,
        attacking with roots that drain the poor citizens of their blood.</p><br>
    <p>Young Devil Hunter Nero races into Red Grave aboard the mobile
        Devil May Cry vehicle with his partner Nico, a self-styled
        "artisan of arms" who provides Nero with his new weapons.</p><br>
    <p>Nero seeks to recover many things in Red Grave:
        Lost pride...stolen power...and a man left behind.</p><br>
    <p>Brandishing his beloved Red Queen sword and custom Blue Rose revolver,
        Nero plunges into Red Grave, routing the demon hordes as he makes for the
        menacing phenomenon in the city center.</p><br>
    <p>All the while, a new power crackles through his right arm...
        The all-new anti-demon arm known as the Devil Breaker.
        "Not bad...let's see what this can do!"</p><br>
